- 👋 Hi, I’m Carl Villa-Real
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, game development, and software design
- I'm currently attending California State University, East Bay for a bachelor's degree in computer science, but I decided to take a break for a year due to health concerns, such as stress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any person who is good at drawing video game design (or pixel art), and/or good at making audio and networking
