- 👋 Hi, I’m Carl Villa-Real
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, game development, and software design
- I'm planning to attend Southern New Hampshire University online program for bachelor's degree in computer science after switching from CSU East Bay hybrid program due to high transportation cost and low curriculum.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any person who is good at drawing video game design (or pixel art), and/or good at making audio and networking
